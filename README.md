# Etch A Sketch
    #1 : Identify problem
    I'd like a interactive dynamic grid of divs that when hovers/active is being colored by a chosen color by the user.
    the grid should be set to any size from 4 (arbitrary number) to a 1000 (same). The grid can be erased, cleared or even randomized!

    #2 : Sketch the Etch - game plan.
    Set user input for number by slide.
    Set function to create div grid using the input.
    Make sure grid works with any number.
        - Only grids with whole square root.
    Set a draw function - activates Hover = specific color.
    Set color function - activates the chosen color.
    Set clear function - sets all DIVs to white.
    Set an erase function - sets chosen color to white.
    Set random color function for rainbow option.
    Set random grey-scale function for old-school option.
    Combine
